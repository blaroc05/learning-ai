# Sentiment Analysis with Node.js 

## Script Description  
This Node.js script is a practical tutorial on performing **sentiment analysis** using the `natural` library. It demonstrates how to evaluate the emotional tone of textâ€”whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. By breaking text into individual words and leveraging a predefined sentiment dataset, the script calculates a sentiment score and outputs it.  

This guide is designed to help JavaScript developers integrate AI-driven text analysis into their projects without switching to Python.  

## How to Run the Script  

1. **Install dependencies**: Make sure you have Node.js installed, then run the following command to install the required library:  

   ```bash
   npm install natural
   ```

2. **Run the script**: Edit the `text` variable in `index.js` to the text you want to analyze. Then, execute the script:  

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```  

3. **View results**: The script will:  
   - Process the input text.  
   - Split the text into individual words.  
   - Calculate a sentiment score based on the emotional tone.  
   - Output the score.

## Results  

+ **Sentiment Score**: The script generates a sentiment score that reflects the emotional tone of the input text.  
+ **Text Analysis**: Sample texts like "I love this product!" will return a positive score and emoji, while "This is terrible!" will return a negative result.

## Conclusion  

This tutorial introduces sentiment analysis in **Node.js**, highlighting how JavaScript can be a viable tool for AI-driven tasks. Using the `natural` library, we transformed text into meaningful insights with minimal effort.  

By completing this tutorial, you'll be equipped to integrate sentiment analysis into your own projects, such as customer feedback tools, social media monitoring apps, or content moderation systems. For more complex use cases, you can explore advanced NLP libraries like TensorFlow.js or external APIs for deeper sentiment analysis.
