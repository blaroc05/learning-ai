# Step-by-Step Tutorial on Data Preprocessing with Pandas

## Script Description
This python script contains a comprehensive tutorial on data preprocessing using Pandas. It demonstrates the key techniques necessary to prepare and clean your data before applying machine learning or AI algorithms. The tutorial focuses on handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, and feature engineering with a sample retail sales dataset.

By following this guide, you'll learn how to transform raw, messy data into a clean, structured dataset ready for model training.

## How to Run the Script

1. **Install dependencies**: Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```
2. **Run the script**: Execute the script from the command line or your preferred IDE:
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```
3. **View results**: The script performs the following actions:
   - Loads the sample dataset.
   - Cleans the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.
   - Outputs the cleaned dataset

   The script also prints a summary of the dataset at various stages for you to review the transformations.

## Results ##
+ **Cleaned Data**: After running the script, you will have a cleaned version of the dataset with missing values handled and duplicates removed.
+ **Feature Engineering**: New features such as TotalSales will be added to the dataset.
+ **Visual Inspection**: Summary statistics and sample rows will be displayed to verify the changes.

## Conclusion ##
This tutorial demonstrates the fundamentals of data preprocessing using Pandas. By cleaning your dataset, handling missing values, and engineering features, you ensure that your data is in the best possible format for machine learning models.

By completing this tutorial, you'll be better equipped to tackle real-world datasets and prepare them for AI applications. For larger datasets or more complex transformations, you may consider integrating other libraries such as scikit-learn for more advanced preprocessing tasks.
