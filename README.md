<img alt="learning_ai" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b6c4542-31c1-4565-bf9e-a3a1dab7dcd8">

Welcome to the **Learning AI** repository! This project is a collection of tutorials aimed at helping you understand and implement artificial intelligence concepts from scratch. The tutorials cover a variety of topics, providing hands-on coding examples, explanations, and step-by-step guides to build AI models and algorithms.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following structure:

```
learning-ai/
│
├── README.md                # This file
└── tutorials/               # Folder containing all AI tutorials
    ├── 01_neural-network-from-scratch/  # Example tutorial on building a neural network
    └── ...                        # More tutorials
```

Each tutorial is placed in its own subfolder within the `tutorials/` directory, containing Python scripts, datasets (if applicable), and a tutorial-specific `README.md` for detailed instructions.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learning-ai.git
   cd learning-ai
   ```

2. **Run tutorials**: Navigate to the respective tutorial folder and follow the instructions in the tutorial-specific `README.md`. Each tutorial contains Python scripts you can run to apply the concepts and build AI models.
