# Learning AI - Tutorials Repository

Welcome to the **Learning AI** repository! This project is a collection of tutorials aimed at helping you understand and implement artificial intelligence concepts from scratch. The tutorials cover a variety of topics, providing hands-on coding examples, explanations, and step-by-step guides to build AI models and algorithms.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following structure:

```
learning-ai/
│
├── README.md                # This file
├── tutorials/               # Folder containing all AI tutorials
│   ├── 01_neural-network-from-scratch/  # Example tutorial on building a neural network
│   ├── 02_linear-regression/          # Example tutorial on linear regression
│   └── ...                        # More tutorials
├── requirements.txt         # Python dependencies for the project
└── .gitignore               # Git ignore file
```

Each tutorial is placed in its own subfolder within the `tutorials/` directory, containing Python scripts, datasets (if applicable), and a tutorial-specific `README.md` for detailed instructions.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learning-ai.git
   cd learning-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**: Each tutorial will specify the required Python libraries in its own subfolder. For global dependencies, check the `requirements.txt` file and install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run tutorials**: Navigate to the respective tutorial folder and follow the instructions in the tutorial-specific `README.md`. Each tutorial contains Python scripts you can run to apply the concepts and build AI models.
